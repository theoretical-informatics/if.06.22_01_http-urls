## HTTP Urls

### General Description
In this assignment you are to develop a regular expression which is able to check a given string whether it is a valid HTTP url string. The requirements are given in the form of unit tests.

### Trained Skills
- Working with Intellij idea
- Working with Java
- Reading unit tests (understand requirements by examples)
- Working with git

### Required Tasks
1. Clone this assignment
1. Open the Intellij project
1. Start the project and see all unit tests fail
1. Read the first unit test and understand what it requires to make it pass
1. Find the simplest implementation to make this test pass
1. Commit this state of your project
1. Repeat the last three steps for the remaining unit tests
1. Push your solution

### Grading
Exercises are pieces of work where you can (and partly should) work together. The importants step is to gain understanding. Working together means discussing, trying, failing, discussing, trying, ... On the other hand, working together does **not** mean copying someones solution and uploading them as your own. Therefore, the main reason for getting graded down is to push a repository with only one or two commits. You are expected to have at least *n* commits if *n* unit tests are given. Otherwise your solution will be graded down.
